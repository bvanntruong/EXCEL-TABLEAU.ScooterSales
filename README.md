# Electric Scooter Sales
The sales data has been checked to remove duplicates, identify nulls, and standardize number formats. 
Then the data is transformed into a table for manipulation.
## Business Questions
Now I am able to review and answer the business questions using IF formulas.

## Sales by Salesperson
I want the sales information for each salesperson in a pivot table for easy filtering. They should be grouped by state as well.
The columns should include Total Clients, the Average Sales Per Client, and Total Sales Per Salesperson.
I have included a slicer to easily filter by salesperson.

## Sales by State
While we are able to consolidate the last pivot table to view sales data by state, I want to clean up the table and include different columns.
I created a new pivot table and slicer, organized by state. 
The new columns include Total Sales, Average Sales Per Client, and Total Commission earned.

## Excel Dashboard
The sales data is then visualized into a dashboard to display our findings. 
It includes our Pivot Tables, Pivot Bar Charts with Slicers, and a Pie Chart to display Sales Revenue by State.

## Tableau Dashboard
I also created a dashboard in Tableau for dynamic viewing.
